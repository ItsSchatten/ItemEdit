**This is a fork of ItemEdit see [this repository](https://github.com/emanondev/ItemEdit) for the base version of this.**

ItemEdit is a plugin for spigot.<br>
The goal of ItemEdit is to allow the user (admins and creative users mostly) to edit minecraft items adding and changing
vanilla properties.<br>The plugin also allows saving items to use them later for use as rewards or for economy purposes.

ItemEdit is **fast**, **easy to use**, **user-friendly** and **free**!

## Downloads

There is no download hosted for this fork.

## Support

This version of ItemEdit is built to mainly support the latest versions of [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) and
backwards compatibility nor compatability with base Spigot is not a priority of this fork.
